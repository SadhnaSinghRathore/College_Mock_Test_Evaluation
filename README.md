# College_Mock_Test_Evaluation

"The ability to take data - to be able to understand it, process it, extract value from it, visualize it, communicate it - is going to be a hugely important skill over the next decades."

 So we are glad to share with all of you that we successfully completed our project using Business Intelligence (BI) Platform - Microsoft Power BI.

  By using this next generation AI tool we are able to unleash the full potential of our data and also track real-time metrics across their fast-growing business, enabling data-driven decision making and helping us turn data into actionable insights with easy visualizations.

*And here is a view of the Project*
